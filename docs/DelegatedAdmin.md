# Assign permissions for delegated administration

As a partner, you have your own account with Microsoft 365, which includes your organization’s user accounts. You can give a user in your own organization the permissions to act as a delegated administrator on behalf of your clients; however, until the client grants delegated administration privileges, you won’t be able to access their organization.
