3) Select "Admin roles" from the drop-down menu.

4) Click on the "Add user" button.

5) Enter the email address of the user you want to grant admin permissions to and select the role you want to assign to them 'Admin Agent'.

6) Click on the "Invite" button to send an invitation to the user.

​		<u>Note:</u> *The user will receive an email with a link to accept the invitation and set up their account. Once they 		have accepted the invitation, they will have the admin permissions that you assigned to them.*

7) Verify the user's role by going back to the "Admin roles" page in the Partner Center and checking that the user's email address is listed with the correct role.

​		<u>Note:</u> *Keep in mind that the user needs to have a valid Microsoft account to be able to accept the invitation 		and gain access to the Partner Center. Also, if the user is already a member of your organization, you 			      		can search for them by name and add them to the role directly.*
